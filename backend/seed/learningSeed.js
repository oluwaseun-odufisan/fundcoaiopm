      content: `FUNDCO CAPITAL MANAGERS — WHO WE ARE

FundCo Capital Managers is authorized and registered by the Nigeria Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to conduct the business of a fund/portfolio manager.

OUR MISSION
To innovatively unlock domestic finance for small and medium-sized infrastructure in unserved or under-served key sectors that:
• Provide essential services to society
• Are recession-resilient
• Demonstrate long-term viability with predictable cashflows
• Reduce the impact of climate change

WHAT IS ALTERNATIVE ASSET MANAGEMENT?
Alternative assets are investments beyond traditional stocks and bonds — they include infrastructure, real estate, private equity, and clean energy projects. FundCo specializes in unlocking DOMESTIC finance (capital from within Nigeria) for these infrastructure investments.

OUR STRATEGIC POSITION
As demands for asset allocation to alternatives continue to increase, FundCo sees a market where alternatives are becoming more valuable relative to conventional assets, and supply remains insufficient. We address this gap.

OUR RANGE OF ACTIVITIES
FundCo currently has its Portfolio Management and advisory businesses with:
• N5.5BN assets under management (AUM)
• Up to N90 billion of advisory mandates and pipeline
• 7 mandates under management
• N6BN mandate executed

ACTIVITIES OVERVIEW
1. Deal Origination: 500,000 potential new connections; 8 off-grid companies lined up for funding
2. Structuring: Blended Finance, Project Finance, Asset Finance (N90BN pipeline)
3. Advisory: N200BN Private Capital Bond (PCB) Program
4. Portfolio Management: AUM N3.3B (CEF) + AUM N2.3B (HSF)

CORPORATE STRUCTURE
FundCo manages TWO funds:
1. Housing Solution Fund (HSF) — AUM N2.3BN
2. Clean Energy Local Currency Fund (CEF) — AUM N3.3BN

Under CEF, FundCo has FOUR operating subsidiaries (AssetCos):
• Electrify MicroGrid Limited (EML)
• GroSolar AssetCo Limited (GroSolar)
• Agronomie
• Swap Station Mobility Limited (SSM)

OUR INVESTMENT APPROACH
FundCo's investment approach holds great potential to deliver the three pillars of the SDGs:
• Economic sustainability
• Environmental sustainability
• Social sustainability

We do this sustainably in partnership with development partners, thought-leaders in blended finance, infrastructure, technology, and development finance.

STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS
• LCY Guarantor: InfraCredit Nigeria
• Equity Partner: All-On
• Pension Fund Investors: NLPC PFA, FCMB Pensions, Access-ARM Pensions, Leadway Pensure, Oak Pensions, Radix Pension

      content: `HOUSING SOLUTION FUND (HSF)

The Housing Solution Fund is a local currency real estate investment, trusted and conceptualised alongside its development partners, to provide innovative market-based solutions to stimulate housing demand and scale housing supply.

HOW HSF WORKS
HSF provides affordable and accessible long-dated home loans to eligible homebuyers in partnership with:
• Participating lending institutions (mortgage banks)
• Housing developers

KEY STATISTICS
• AUM: N2.3BN
• Structure: Blended fund

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
To deliver inflation-protected income and capital growth over the medium term for investors by funding a diversified portfolio of affordable home loan assets across Nigeria, which will provide good quality accommodation to homeowners.

WHY LOCAL CURRENCY?
By providing loans in Nigerian Naira (NGN) rather than foreign currencies, HSF:
• Eliminates foreign exchange (FX) risk for both borrowers and developers
• Makes repayments predictable and stable
• Supports the development of Nigeria's domestic capital markets

THE HOUSING OPPORTUNITY
The housing sector holds great potential to deliver the three pillars of the SDGs:
• Economic sustainability
• Environmental sustainability
• Social sustainability

FOUR THEMATIC FOCUS AREAS (SDG Aligned)
HSF focuses on four thematic areas strongly aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals:
1. Affordable Housing Access — SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities)
2. Financial Inclusion — SDG 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 8 (Decent Work)
3. Climate-Resilient Construction — SDG 13 (Climate Action)
4. Women and Youth Housing Support — SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities)

HOW HSF STIMULATES THE ECONOMY
• Creates demand for housing construction → drives employment
• Enables mortgage access for underserved Nigerians
• Partners with mortgage lending banks to reach eligible homebuyers
• Long-dated loans (longer repayment periods) → affordable monthly payments
• Builds a diversified portfolio across multiple states and income segments`,

Example: "The CAPEX for the Umon Island mini-grid included solar panels, inverters, and the energy cabin."

2. OPEX (Operational Expenditure)
Day-to-day RUNNING COSTS of an energy system:
- Fuel and maintenance
- Staff salaries and monitoring costs
- Site security
Example: "OPEX for a mini-grid includes the engineer's monthly salary and spare parts."

3. PPA (Power Purchase Agreement)
A long-term CONTRACT where a buyer agrees to purchase power from a clean energy provider at an agreed rate.
Key features: Fixed price, long duration (often 10-20 years), reduces revenue risk for operators.

4. Tariff Rate
The price per kWh charged to customers for electricity supply.
Mini-grids must set tariffs that: cover OPEX, repay debt, remain affordable for customers, and allow profit margin.

5. LCOE (Levelized Cost of Energy)
The AVERAGE COST per unit of electricity generated over the LIFETIME of a clean-energy system.
Formula: LCOE = Total Lifecycle Cost ÷ Total Lifetime Energy Production
Lower LCOE = More competitive/efficient system.

6. Debt Financing
Borrowing funds from banks or investors to fund energy projects, REPAYABLE WITH INTEREST.
Example: CEF provides debt financing (loan notes) to mini-grid developers.

7. Equity Financing
Raising capital by SELLING OWNERSHIP STAKE to investors.
Example: All-On provides equity investment to clean energy companies.

8. ROI (Return on Investment)
Measures how PROFITABLE an energy project is relative to its cost.
Formula: ROI = (Net Profit ÷ Cost of Investment) × 100%

9. Payback Period
Time it takes for an energy project to RECOVER ITS INITIAL INVESTMENT from net cash flows.
Shorter payback = less risky project.

10. Green Bonds
Fixed-income instruments used to finance ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE projects.
CEF is green-bond certified — the first and only in Nigeria.

11. Carbon Credits
Tradable permits earned from REDUCING CARBON EMISSIONS.
Each credit = 1 tonne CO₂ avoided. Can be sold on carbon markets for additional revenue.

12. Working Capital
Funds available for DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS like fuel, maintenance, and staff payments.
Formula: Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities

13. Depreciation
Gradual reduction in the VALUE of clean-energy assets over time:
- Inverters: typically 5-10 years
- Batteries: 5-7 years
- Solar panels: 25+ years

14. Amortization
Gradual repayment of INTANGIBLE ASSETS or LOAN PRINCIPAL over time.
Example: A 10-year loan is amortized through monthly payments of principal plus interest.

15. Energy Yield
Total amount of ELECTRICITY GENERATED by a system — used to calculate revenue.
Revenue = kWh generated × tariff rate

16. Revenue Assurance
Processes to ensure accurate billing, correct metering, and FULL REVENUE COLLECTION.
Includes smart metering, customer database management, and collection enforcement.

17. Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)
Comparison of all project costs vs. expected benefits BEFORE INVESTMENT.
CEF requires CBA for every project in its portfolio.

18. NPL (Non-Performing Loans)
Loans where customers are NOT REPAYING on time. CEF monitors NPLs to assess portfolio risk.

19. Asset Leasing
Renting or leasing solar equipment or mini-grid assets to customers or partners.
GroSolar's SaaS model is a form of asset leasing.

20. BoQ (Bill of Quantities)
Detailed document listing MATERIALS, COMPONENTS, LABOUR, and COSTS required for a project.
Used in engineering, construction, and solar installations.

21. BEES (Building for Environmental and Economic Sustainability)
Rating and assessment tool developed to evaluate buildings or projects based on:
- Energy Efficiency
- Economic Feasibility
- Environmental Impact

22. kWh (kilowatt-hour)
Unit of ENERGY measuring how much electricity is used or generated over time.
1 kWh = using 1,000 watts of power for 1 hour.

23. kWp (kilowatt-peak)
The MAXIMUM CAPACITY OUTPUT a solar PV system can produce under Standard Test Conditions:
- Full sunlight (1,000 W/m²)
- Panel temperature 25°C
Example: "EML manages a 50 kWp mini-grid on Umon Island."`,
